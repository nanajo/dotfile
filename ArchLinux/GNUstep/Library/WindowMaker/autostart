# Place applications to be executed when WindowMaker is started here.
# This should only be used for non-X applications or applications that
# do not support session management. Other applications should be restarted
# by the WindowMaker session restoring mechanism. For that, you should
# either set SaveSessionOnExit=YES or select "Save Session" in the Workspace
# submenu of the root menu when all applications you want started are
# running.

# WindowMaker will wait until this script finishes, so if you run any
# commands that take long to execute (like a xterm), put a ``&'' in the
# end of the command line.
